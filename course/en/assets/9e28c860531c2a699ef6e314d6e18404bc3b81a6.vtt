00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well it's clearly not enough for any
human being to have confidence in another one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For you simply to believe that they're
worthy of trust you need to kind of be

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
able to verify the specific statements
that they're making

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the specific information they're conveying and that's
really all about quality.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 in the context of statistics it's what are the numbers
where are they from what are the data sources

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
how have they been collected what are
the risks, the biases, that might sit underneath 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
those numbers, let's be clear about those
what are the methods that are used to take those numbers distill them

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
model them and profile them and then
finally one of their kind of strengths and limitations of the resulting output

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What can it tell you and what can't it tell you?.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
All of those things we wrap up as quality
and it's a really kind of data led notion of quality

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it starts with the data what the data are and how they are
used to create statistical insight

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
statistical meaning I think it's also worth saying that
failing to do those things

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
failing to live up to this set of requirements in this pillar
runs a really significant risk that statistics are misleading

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that the numbers that are produced
tell people things which are not faithful representations

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of the world that they're trying to capture
And that's really important for us that the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
code supports statistics that are meaningful and are
statistical output or an even simpler thing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That the organization will commit
not materially misleading

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this quality pillar is the sort of central pillar of the statistics
following on from trustworthiness
